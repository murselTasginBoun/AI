# The Seven Deadly Sins of AI Predictions

1. **Overestimating and underestimating**

*Amara's Law:* We tend to overestimate the effect of a technology in the short run and 
underestimate the effect in the long run.

2. **Imagining magic**

Arthur C. Clarke (science fiction writer) formulated three adages known as Clarke's Three Laws:

 * When a distinguished but elderly scientist states that something is possible, he is almost 
certainly right. When he states that something is impossible, he is very probably wrong.
 * The only way of discovering the limits of the possible is to venture a little way past them into the impossible.
 * Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.

3. **Performance versus competence**

Human can perform some tasks better than AI but it does not mean that AI is useless. 
There are cases that AI can do tasks with high performance while some other tasks are handled better by humans.

4. **Suitcase Words**
Marvin Minsky called words that carry a variety of meanings "suitcase words". Learning is a powerful suitcase word.
AI success stories are somehow exaggerated and suitcase words are used.

5. **Exponentials**
Many people are suffering from a severe case of "exponentialism".
Performance of AI systems increased with the help of deep learning. 
However there is no "law" that says what will be the next rapid-step increase in the performance of AI systems.

6. **Hollywood scenarios**
AI will not change our lives immediately as film scenarios. 
New technologies will arrive but more gradually.

7. **Speed of deployment**
Many new technology companies, factories are still using decades old mechanical systems and technologies.
Although a lot of AI research is carried and tools & techniques are created, deployment of these systems, tools
inside existing business process and operations will take time and effort.
