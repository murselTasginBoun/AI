# The Seven Deadly Sins of AI Predictions

1. **Overestimating and underestimating**

*Amara's Law:* We tend to overestimate the effect of a technology in the short run and 
underestimate the effect in the long run.

2. **Imagining magic**

Arthur C. Clarke (science fiction writer) formulated three adages known as Clarke's Three Laws:

 * When a distinguished but elderly scientist states that something is possible, he is almost 
certainly right. When he states that something is impossible, he is very probably wrong.
 * The only way of discovering the limits of the possible is to venture a little way past them into the impossible.
 * Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.
